# Introduction to Event Sourcing and CQRS
Presented at Orlando Code Camp March 30th, 2019.

## Description:
Netflix does it. Banks do it. Perhaps you've heard about Event Sourcing and CQRS but the concepts just don't click or you haven't seen a simple enough example so that it does. Learn about the basics of Event Sourcing as we model a Bank Account. This presentation will focus mainly on tactical patterns and simple implementations. Live coding will be done using .NET Core.
